Fast Installation Guide
=======================

You need to have a webserver (we have tested the system with Apache),
PHP3 or PHP4, PHPLib and MySQL installed on your system.

Two installation and configuration methods are provided:

Using Installation Script
-------------------------

1. Go to the directory where your HTML files resides
   and untar the DevCounter archive:

   user$ cd /usr/local/httpd/htdocs
   user$ tar -zxvf devcounter-x.x.x.tar.gz

2. Execute the installation script and follow the
   instruction.

   http://yourserver/devcounter-x.x.x/install.php


Manual Installation
-------------------

1. Go to the directory where your HTML files resides
   and untar the DevCounter archive:

   user$ cd /usr/local/httpd/htdocs
   user$ tar -zxvf devcounter-x.x.x.tar.gz

2. Set up the database user account for DevCounter
   and create the DevCounter database:

   user$ mysql -h host -u database_superuser -p
   (insert superuser_password)
   mysql> USE mysql;
   mysql> INSERT INTO user VALUES ( 'host', 'operator', PASSWORD('operator_password'), 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N');
   mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   mysql> CREATE DATABASE devcounter;
   mysql> exit;

3. Go to the DevCounter directory and
   create DevCounter tables and defaults:

   user$ cd /usr/local/httpd/htdocs/devcounter-x.x.x
   user$ mysql -h host -u operator -p < sql/tables.sql
   (insert db_password)
   user$ mysql -h host -u operator -p < sql/defaults.sql
   (insert db_password)

4. Set database parameters in devcounter-x.x.x/include/local.inc;
   keep devcounter as the database name

   user$ cd /usr/local/httpd/htdocs/devcounter-x.x.x
   user$ vi include/local.inc

   var $Host     = "host";
   var $Database = "devcounter";
   var $User     = "operator";
   var $Password = "password";

5. Set path to PHPLib directory in devcounter-x.x.x/include/prepend.php3:

   user$ cd /usr/local/httpd/htdocs/devcounter-x.x.x
   user$ include/prepend.php3

   $_PHPLIB["libdir"] = "/usr/share/php/phplib/";

Ok, that's it. You've finished installing and configuring
DevCounter. Start your browser and visit:

   http://yourserver/devcounter-x.x.x/index.php

As you'll see, DevCounter comes only with the administrator.
You can modify your profile. To do so, login as the default
administrator with user,editor,admin permissions.
At the prompt use the following ID to login
(case sensitive):

    Username: admin
    Password: admin

Very important: Be sure that you immediately change the username and
password by clicking on the User Admin link. You'll notice this is
quite easy to do ;-)

Have fun!
