Fast Installation Guide
-----------------------

You need to have a webserver (we have tested the system with Apache),
PHP3 or PHP4, PHPLib and MySQL installed in your system.

* user$ mysql -h host -u database_superuser -p
  (insert superuser_password)
* mysql> USE mysql;
* mysql> INSERT INTO user VALUES ( 'host', 'operator', PASSWORD('operator_password'), 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N');
* mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
* mysql> CREATE DATABASE devcounter;
* mysql> exit;
* user$ tar -zxvf devcounter-x.x.tar.gz
* user$ mysql -h host -u operator -p < devcounter/sql/devcounter.sql
  (create tables)
* user$ mysql -h host -u operator -p < devcounter/sql/auth_user.sql
  (insert the administrator account)
* user$ mysql -h host -u operator -p < devcounter/sql/countries.sql
  (insert default values for countries)
* user$ mysql -h host -u operator -p < devcounter/sql/faq.sql
  (insert default values for faq)
* user$ mysql -h host -u operator -p < devcounter/sql/languages.sql
  (insert default values for languages)
* user$ mysql -h host -u operator -p < devcounter/sql/prog_abilities.sql
  (insert default values for programming abilities)
* user$ mysql -h host -u operator -p < devcounter/sql/prog_languages.sql
  (insert default values for programming languages/tools)
* user$ vi devcounter/include/local.inc
  (insert the correct database parameters; please, keep devcounter as the database name)

   var $Host     = "localhost";
   var $Database = "devcounter";
   var $User     = "operator";
   var $Password = "password";

Ok, that's it. You've finished installing and configuring
DevCounter. Start your browser and visit
http://yourserver/devcounter/index.php.
As you'll see, DevCounter comes with only with the administrator.
You can modify your profile by entering as an administrator.
To do so, login as the default administrator with user,editor,admin
permissions. At the prompt use the following ID to login
(case sensitive):

    Username: oldfish
    Password: oldfish

Vert important: Be sure of immediately changing the login and password by
clicking on the User Admin link. You'll notice this is quite easy to do ;-)
