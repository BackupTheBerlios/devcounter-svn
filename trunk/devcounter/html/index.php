<P><H2>DevCounter</H2>

<P>DevCounter queries open source developers for their knowledge and experiences as well as their cooperation in open source projects.

<P>It is based in <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/phplib/">PHP</A> and uses <A HREF="http://www.mysql.com">MySQL</A> as its database system. DevCounter depends on
the <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/phplib/">PHPLib library</A> (version 7.2 or
later). Future versions may have database independence, but this is
not yet supported. We are still working on it. Only if you want to have
diary and weekly mailing lists with the announcements, you should also have
Mailman installed in your box.

<P>You can see a fully working example of the DevCounter system at BerliOS
DevCounter by visiting <A HREF="http://devcounter.berlios.de">http://devcounter.berlios.de</A>. A close look at it will show you what
you can do with DevCounter. BerliOS DevCounter has at this moment more
than 750 documents inserted and has been the main reason why we have
made this software.

<P>BerliOS DevCounter is part of the BerliOS project at FOKUS. Please, have
a look at <A HREF="http://www.berlios.de">http://www.berlios.de</A> for further information.

<P>DevCounter can be easily translated into different
languages. If you see that DevCounter does not have support in your
language, you're gladly invited to <A HREF="translating.php">help us with the
internationalization</A> of DevCounter by sending us your translation.

<P>You can download the latest version of DevCounter (sources and documentation) at:
