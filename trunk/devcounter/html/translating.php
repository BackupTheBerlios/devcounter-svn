<A NAME="international"></A>
<P><H2>International support</H2>

<P>DevCounter can be easily translated into different
languages. If you see that DevCounter does not have support in your
language, you're gladly invited to help us with the
internationalization of DevCounter by sending us your translation.

<P>You don't need to have any computer or programming experience to do a
translation. Keep on reading and you'll find out how easy it is.

<A NAME="normal_outputs"></A>
<P><H3>1. Main outputs</H3>

<P>Download the <A HREF="../include/lang-translate.inc">lang-translate.inc</A> file (it also comes in DevCounter's tarball). If you edit it, you'll find lines
like this:

<PRE>
     case "Home": $tmp = ""; break;
</PRE>

<P>We will explain it briefly: after the <I>case</I> you will see the English text to translate writen in
quotes (in our example, the English text is "Home"). Then you'll find a
sort of equation. The content of your translation from English into your language should
be placed in between these second quotes. For example, in the case you were making a translation into German, this would be the result for this line:

<PRE>
     case "Home": $tmp = "Heim"; break;
</PRE>

<P>Ok, now that you're an expert, you'll notice that "Home" is translated
into German as "Heim" ;-). The procedure just explained should be repeated with
all the lines in this file. 

<P>Once you're finished, save it as <I>YourLanguage-lang.inc</I> and please send it to the authors. We will include
it in the next releases so that everybody can benefit of your work.

<A NAME="faq_file"></A>
<P><H3>2. The FAQ-file</H3>

<P>Translating the FAQ file is a little more complicated at a first view,
but a closer look at it will make you see it is not that much. Download
<A HREF="../include/English-faq.inc">English-faq.inc</A> (this file comes also with the DevCounter tarball) and edit it with your favorite editor. You should be
able to read things like these:

<PRE>
     "How to change my Password or E-mail
      address I am registered with?" =>
     "Select \"&lt;a href=chguser.php&gt;".$t-&gt;translate
      ("Change User")."&lt;/a&gt;\"
      and enter your new parameters. ",
</PRE>

<P>You should translate everything that is in between the quotes into
your language. Don't worry about HTML tags (like <I>&lt;a href="....php&gt;</I>) and
other functions (<I>$t-&gt;translate("....")</I>). Just don't translate them.

<P>As an example, you can see here the German translation of the upper
paragraph:

<PRE>
    "Wie ändere ich mein Passwort oder E-Mail-Adresse?" =&gt;
    "Wählen Sie \"&lt;a href=chguser.php&gt;".$t-&gt;translate
    ("Change User")."&lt;/a&gt;\" und geben Sie Ihre neuen Daten ein.",
</PRE>

<P>Once you're finished, save it as <I>YourLanguage-faq.inc</I> and please send it to the authors. We will include
it in the next releases so that everybody can benefit from your work.
